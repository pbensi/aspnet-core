Note: Secret and Metadata Files
To make this template work, you will need to provide two key files:

# 1. Secret File:
This contains sensitive configuration details such as API keys, database credentials, and other private information. Make sure this file is kept secure and is not shared publicly.

# 2. Metadata File: 
This file includes necessary configuration or environment data that the application needs to run correctly. It may contain environment-specific settings, deployment information, or other critical data.
